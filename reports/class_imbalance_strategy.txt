================================================================

Date: 2025-11-28
Phase: 2 - Class Imbalance Analysis
Prepared by: Abdallah

1. DATASET CHARACTERISTICS
   - Total Providers: 5410
   - Fraudulent Providers: 506 (9.35%)
   - Legitimate Providers: 4904 (90.65%)
   - Imbalance Ratio: 9.69:1

2. SELECTED STRATEGY: HYBRID APPROACH

   Primary Method: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
   - Sampling Strategy: 0.5 (fraud class = 50% of majority)
   - K-neighbors: 5
   - Random State: 42
   - Result: 7356 total samples after SMOTE

   Alternative Method: SMOTEENN (SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors)
   - For noise reduction and cleaner decision boundaries
   - Removes -1772 samples after SMOTE
   - Result: 9128 total samples after cleaning

   Baseline Method: Class Weighting
   - Fraud weight: 5.35
   - Legit weight: 0.55

3. RATIONALE
   - SMOTE chosen over undersampling to preserve all legitimate provider data
   - Moderate sampling strategy (0.5) to avoid overfitting on synthetic samples
   - Class weighting as baseline for tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - SMOTEENN for potential model improvement through noise reduction

4. EXPORTED DATASETS FOR PHASE 3
   a) data_original_with_weights.csv - Original data (use with class_weight parameter)
   b) data_smote_resampled.csv - SMOTE oversampled data
   c) data_smoteenn_cleaned.csv - SMOTE + ENN cleaned data
   d) class_weights.json - Computed class weights for models

5. RECOMMENDED EVALUATION METRICS (Priority Order)
   1. PR-AUC (Precision-Recall Area Under Curve) - PRIMARY METRIC
      * Most appropriate for imbalanced classification
      * Focus on positive class performance

   2. F1-Score
      * Harmonic mean of precision and recall
      * Target: > 0.70

   3. Recall (Sensitivity/True Positive Rate)
      * Minimize false negatives (missing fraud)
      * Target: > 0.75

   4. Precision (Positive Predictive Value)
      * Minimize false positives (false accusations)
      * Target: > 0.65

   5. AVOID: Accuracy
      * Misleading with 9.7:1 imbalance
      * Can achieve 90.6% by always predicting "legit"

6. CROSS-VALIDATION STRATEGY
   - Use Stratified K-Fold (k=5) to maintain class proportions
   - Apply SMOTE ONLY on training folds (prevent data leakage)
   - Evaluate on original (unsampled) validation folds

7. KEY FINDINGS FROM EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
   Significantly different features between fraud/legit (p < 0.05):

   - total_claim_count: Fraud mean=420.55, Legit mean=70.44
   - total_sum_amt: Fraud mean=584350.04, Legit mean=53193.72
   - mean_amt_overall: Fraud mean=3842.80, Legit mean=1523.78
   - pct_inpatient: Fraud mean=0.33, Legit mean=0.13
   - unique_beneficiaries: Fraud mean=247.53, Legit mean=49.39
